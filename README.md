#TODO

1. Extract common values, like gap, gap-sm, gap-lg, gap-xl, gap-xs and etc into a separate scss file which uses CSS variables (tokens), and usage in here would be: gap: var(--gap);, extract prop values like, sizes, font sizes, font family, gaps, spaces, colors.

2. Let's make add new todo not a simple text input, but multiline textarea as wll.

src/app/components/todo-item/todo-item.component.html
appearance="outline"
class="todo-edit-field" >
<textarea

3. Fix Todo Editing â€“ Cancel on ESC and Prevent Empty Updates.

Pressing ESC during todo edit should cancel the edit.
The original todo text should be immediately restored in the UI without requiring a page refresh.

If the user clears the todo text and confirms the edit (e.g. by pressing Enter or blurring the input): The app must not allow saving an empty string.
Optionally, show a validation message or silently discard the change.

Trim unnecessary leading/trailing whitespace during editing.
